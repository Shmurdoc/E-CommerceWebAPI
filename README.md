# **🚀 eCommerceWebAPI**
Welcome! This is a modern, production-ready e-commerce API built with ASP.NET Core and Entity Framework Core, crafted to highlight best practices in scalable backend development.

I'm a recent graduate passionate about software engineering and always eager to deepen my skills. This project is a hands-on dive into real-world backend architecture, robust testing patterns, and clean, modular coding practices.

### 🔍 Project Highlights
🧱 Clean Architecture: Follows layered, maintainable design patterns inspired by enterprise solutions.

💾 Entity Framework Core: Seamlessly integrates SQL Server through EF Core with support for code-first migrations.

🔐 Authentication: Implements Basic Authentication for protected endpoints (easily extendable to JWT or OAuth).

🧪 Testing: Includes unit and integration tests using xUnit, with custom factories for setup.

🧩 Dependency Injection: Uses Autofac for clean, testable service registration.

⚙️ Configuration: Managed through appsettings.json for environment-specific flexibility.

🧭 API Documentation-Ready: Swagger/OpenAPI integration support baked in.

📦 Extensible Features: Architected to support product catalogs, order workflows, and more.

### 🌱 Why I Built This
I wanted to challenge myself with a real-world project that would push me as a backend developer. This API represents my journey in learning scalable design, secure communication patterns, and automated testing—all while building something meaningful.

## For Basic Authentication in Swagger //(Disabled)
Username is Troy.
Password is located in http header x-user-id (78cf4910-a00e-499f-a6ad-385bbcc5bbf7).
