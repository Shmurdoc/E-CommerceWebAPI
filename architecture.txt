# Project Architecture Design

## Overview
This project is a professional, modular, and testable ASP.NET Web API for eCommerce, following best practices:
- **CQRS** and **MediatR** for command/query separation
- **Repository Pattern** for data access abstraction
- **Dependency Injection** with Autofac
- **API Versioning** and **Swagger** for documentation
- **Serilog** for logging
- **Unit and Integration Tests**

## Layers
- **Controllers**: API endpoints, versioned, thin, delegate to MediatR
- **Handlers**: MediatR command/query handlers, business logic
- **DTOs**: Data transfer objects for API contracts
- **Entities**: Database models
- **Repository**: Data access, implements interfaces
- **Data**: EF Core DbContext
- **Middleware**: Custom authentication, logging, error handling
- **Configurations**: DI, AutoMapper, Swagger, etc.
- **Extensions**: Service and host extensions

## Exception Handling
- All repository and handler methods use try/catch with logging
- Global error handling middleware can be added for API-wide exception management

## Best Practices
- Null checks and defensive coding
- Async/await for all I/O
- Logging at all critical operations
- Unit and integration tests for all business logic
- Separation of concerns and single responsibility

## Improvements for Ownership
- Update namespaces and copyright
- Add/replace author and company info
- Review and refactor for code style and comments
- Ensure all dependencies are up-to-date
